Description: This package implements the K-means clustering algorithm and a supervised K-NN (K Nearest Neighbors) learning method in R. It allows users to perform unsupervised clustering and supervised classification on their datasets. Additional features include data normalization, imputation of missing values, and the choice of distance metric. The package also provides functions to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-means and the best k-value for K-NN: `knn_Function`, `find_Knn_best_k`, `KMEANS_FUNCTION`, and `find_Kmeans_best_k`.
